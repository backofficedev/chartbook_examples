**Description:** These charts display term premium measures over time, calculated as the spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and shorter-term yields (1-year, 2-year, and 3-year). The term premium represents the additional compensation investors demand for holding longer-term bonds.

**Charts in this series:**
- **10Y-1Y Spread**: 10-year minus 1-year yield
- **10Y-2Y Spread**: 10-year minus 2-year yield
- **10Y-3Y Spread**: 10-year minus 3-year yield

**Relevance for Financial Stability:**
- Term premium is a key indicator of investor risk appetite and economic expectations
- An inverted yield curve (negative spread) has historically preceded recessions
- Changes in term premium affect borrowing costs across the economy

**Direction of Risk:**
- **Positive and rising**: Normal conditions, expectations of economic growth
- **Positive and falling**: Flattening curve, growing uncertainty
- **Near zero**: Very flat curve, elevated recession risk
- **Negative**: Inverted curve, historically associated with impending recessions

**Formulas Used:**
- 10Y-1Y Spread = SVENY10 - SVENY01
- 10Y-2Y Spread = SVENY10 - SVENY02
- 10Y-3Y Spread = SVENY10 - SVENY03

**Data Cleaning Information:** Data is sourced directly from the Federal Reserve yield curve dataset with no additional cleaning.

**What does this add?** Provides a long historical perspective on yield curve slope and term premium evolution, useful for understanding current market conditions in historical context.
